# Simple_Calculator
Writing a simple calculator code in Python using basic functions such as if-statements, exception handling, and lists.

I am learning how to code in Python. I created this project to use the basic functions of what I have learned so far. This is a calculator that does basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
